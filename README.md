Rules…without them, we live like animals. That is why most civilizations in history have laws to establish right and wrong, and of course, what rights all of humanity
have, from the biggest of empires, down to the individuals. The term “human rights” was coined, and a gamut of rights all of society should arguably have was established, from the right to have plentiful food and water to be granted the chance to thrive in society to having educational services to bring out the mental gifts in people, or lack thereof. Take the United States as an example, as they fought to seek independence and ratify and maintain a series of amendments, 
some of which address and decide natural rights for people. Discussing natural rights and going into detail about said amendments is essential to understand how the Amendments protect people’s natural rights. 

The purpose of the United States Constitution and its amendments is to protect natural rights by establishing rights that cannot be easily changed or, in some cases, cannot be changed under any circumstances. The founding fathers had to ratify the Constitution because potentially corrupt governments could change human rights for profit. As the fourth president of the United States stated in a paper, “Great injury results from an unstable government. The want of confidence in the public councils damps every useful undertaking.” (Madison, 1788) Understanding this first sets the picture for how each amendment explicitly protects humanity. For example, this first amendment, while not one of the original ten amendments, is critical in human rights. After all, when this amendment was made, society was still evolving its knowledge of natural rights.

Racism, slavery, and the 1800s are complicated topics to discuss in an essay, but when the US Constitution and human rights both pop up simultaneously, it is hard not to talk about the 14th Amendment. The 14th Amendment, one of the Civil War Amendments, addresses equal protection and prosecution of the law. While this law impacted everyone, this law was mainly created for black people because of slavery recently being abolished. A few decades earlier, black people were not human, according to the country's top experts. Although their brains function the same as everyone else, their physical features are the same, and everything is the same except the color of their skin; they were not looked on as humans. Not only back then, views on human rights were evolving endlessly, but they were still figuring out what makes a human. Nevertheless, this amendment opened up many human rights for black people, making the 14th Amendment necessary.
